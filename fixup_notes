error handling:
    admin area:
        orderId left blank throws error
        
        add a product:
               new product field name left blank enters null in database
        
        update account:
            if userId isn't filled in nothing happens and no error is displayed to let you know
            
            
 main page:
        clicking checkout with nothing in the cart throws error as it takes you to the checkout page
        
  
  checkout page:
        if nothing in the cart, clicking complete purchase throws errors.

        if you click complete purchase after removing all your items, still processes and sends email.
